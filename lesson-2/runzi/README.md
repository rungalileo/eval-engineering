# Runzi - a running assistant

Runzi is a demo multi-agent application for runners. It allows you to ask questions around topics such as:

- Running shoe and clothing recommendations
- Training plans for different types of running
- Upcoming races
- Recovery
- Nutrition

This uses mock data, so made up sportswear, shoes, and athletic brands.
